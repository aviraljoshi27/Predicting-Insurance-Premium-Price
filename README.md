# Predicting-Insurance-Premium-Price
This project aims to predict insurance premium prices using customer data and machine learning models(Linear Regression).

## 📌 What This Notebook Does

In this notebook (`Predict_Premium_price.ipynb`), we walk through the end-to-end process of building a predictive model for insurance premium pricing:

1. **Data Import and Setup**
   - We load the dataset containing details like 'Age', 'Diabetes', 'BloodPressureProblems', 'AnyTransplants','AnyChronicDiseases', 'Weight', 'HistoryOfCancerInFamily','NumberOfMajorSurgeries'.
   - We import key Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - We examine dataset structure, check for nulls, and understand data types.
   - We explore distributions, spot trends, and identify correlations between variables.
   - We visualize key insights using plots.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - We split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Building**
   - We build regression models to predict the insurance premium (`charges`).
   - We train models like Linear Regression on the training data.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - We evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like R² Score, RMSE, and MAE.
   - We compare predicted vs. actual values.
   
6. **Key Insights**
   - We identify which factors have the strongest influence on premium pricing.
   - We discuss model improvement opportunities.
